                        <p class="art-para">I’ve been building sites for quite some time. A lot of the times these sites become outdated from more efficient and modern approaches to the same idea so I either delete them or replace them, but nevertheless I had a lot of ‘useless’ web data. During my more active time of freelance web development in the summer of 2018, I started building my cousin, <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://photography.cncstudios.org" target="_blank"><span class="in-text-link">Camille</span></a>, a photography page. Realising at the time that I couldn’t manage the aggregation of additional photography content, I figured that the best solution would be that she would also learn some of the necessary web code for adding more photos and albums. Complete shared knowledge, in my opinion, is the best way to develop a defined, but creative work. In this sense, Camille could continue her photography work whilst not having the website become bland. This process of working from shared knowledge is one of the fundamentals I wish to keep in C&C Studios forever.</p>
                        <p class="art-para">With her showing me her artwork and me helping her with her site, I began to show greater interest in graphic design relative to photography. However, I didn’t start working on photography editing until after the initial launch of C&C Studios. At this time, probably around late August, I finished the first version of her photography page. At the same time, I was working on a concept idea of C&C Studios. Building the project on the side, I’ve realised how much it lacked in digital artwork diversity. Lucky, one of my best mates from high school, <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://austinnguyen.cncstudios.org" target="_blank"><span class="in-text-link">Austin</span></a>, dabbles in a medium of art in which Camille and I have not. With the addition of Austin to the C&C Studios team, I felt that we had enough diversity encompass most relative mediums of digital artwork. Finishing up the site after adding Austin, we launched on the 23 of September, 2018.</p>
                        <p class="art-para">For the next three months, I continued my work in web development, designing and building various sites most of which were photography pages. I also started building personal portfolio sites and demos of other web-based projects, however most of these never we added under a subdomain of C&C Studios. In this span of a few months, I rebuilt my personal website four times. In this time I also redesigned C&C Studios utilising a template I built for Lily Jiang. It wasn’t until late December when I started drawing a concept for an application, which would later become Bobaddict. After spending two months drafting a complete application design, I shared it with Camille, and turns out she had also been conceptualising a similar application. Together, we refined the application design, but are currently stalled due to schooling.</p>
                        <p class="art-para">I’m going to be honest with you: I’ve lost a bit of touch with web development in the first quarter of 2019, but that’s because I started to pick up photoshopping around this time. Through a series of casual discord calls, I picked up a lot on what methods Austin used to create his artwork and built mine around that. My first initial works consist of watercolour paint effects, very simplistic. From there I started using double exposure with this effect to differentiate from Austin’s style, eventually developing my own. You can see all of these in my first artwork exhibition “Pure Urban Colours” on my <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://art.clsnguyen.com" target="_blank"><span class="in-text-link">art subdomain</span></a>. After finishing that exhibit, I needed a new style for the next quarter’s release. After days of wondering, I finally got my inspiration whilst listening to Disclosure’s single, “Omen”. Looking at their album art, I noticed the outlinings of the face on it, I attempted to replicate it on another subject. From then on, I’ve continued this outlining style in which I consider my personal style, and eventually Austin caught on to it.</p>
                        <p class="art-para">So far, I’ve only mentioned two other members of C&C Studios. Camille, Austin, and I are the co-founders of this organisation, each representing a fundamental to digital artwork so it seems appropriate to have a little origin story of each. I think it’s time to add the other lads. The next people added to C&C Studios were <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://alexsuh.cncstudios.org" target="_blank"><span class="in-text-link">Alex</span></a> and Chris, who also attended the same high school as Austin and I. Showing interest in Photoshop, Austin and I added them to the shared Google Drive to learn about the styles in which we use and eventually as members of C&C Studios.</p>
                        <p class="art-para">Finally, we come to our latest member, <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://owengong.cncstudios.org" target="_blank"><span class="in-text-link">Owen</span></a>. The C&C Studios team has known him for quite some time, as we attended the same school district and had similar friend circles, and approached me on a personalised website. Are building his site, an iteration of my redesign7, I realised that his potential for backend coding experience would also help expand the coding medium for C&C Studios. So there we have it, the beginning of C&C, and what it is today.</p>
